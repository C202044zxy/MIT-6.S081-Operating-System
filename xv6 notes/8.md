## 8.1 Overview

The xv6 file system is organized in seven layers, shown in Figure 8.1.

Let talk about these layers from bottom to the top:

- The disk layer reads and writes blocks on an virtio hard drive. 
- The buffer cache layer synchronizes access to disk, making sure that only one kernel thread can modify the data stored in a certain block.
- The logging layer allows higher layer to wrap updates to several blocks in a *transaction*, and ensures that the blocks are updated atomically with respect to crashes (i.e. all of them are updated or none).
- The inode layer represents each individual file as an inode. 
- The directory layer implements each directory as a special kind of inode whose content is a sequence of directory entries.
- The pathname layer provides hierarchical path names and resolves them with recursive lookup. 
- The file descriptor layer abstracts many Unix resources (e.g., pipes, devices, files, etc.) using the file system interface.

As Figure 8.2 shows, xv6 divides the disk into several sections. Block $1$ is called superblock, containing the metadata of the file system. Bitmap blocks tracking which data blocks are in use.

## 8.4 Logging layer

One of the most interesting problems in file system design is crash recovery. The problem arise because many file-system operations involve multiple writes to the disk, and a crash after a subset of the writes may leave the on-disk file system in an inconsistent state.

Xv6 solves the problem of crashes during file-system operations using logging. The system call doesn't directly write the on-disk file system data structure. Instead, it places a log on disk, which records all uncommitted disk writes. Once the system call has logged all of its writes, it writes a special *commit* record to the disk, indicating that the log contains a complete operation.

The file system recovers from the crash as follows. If the log is marked as a complete operation, then the recovery code copies the writes to where they belong in the on-disk file system. If the log is not marked as containing a complete operation, the recovery code ignores the log. 

## 8.5 Log design

The header block of block contains an array of block numbers and a count of log blocks. The count in the header block **on disk** is either zero, indicating there is no transaction in the log, or none zero, indicating the log contains a committed transaction.

To allow concurrent execution of file-system operations by different processes, the logging system can accumulate the writes of multiple system calls into one transaction. To avoid splitting a system call across transactions, the logging system only commits when no file-system system calls are underway.

## 8.6 Code: logging

A typical use of the log in a system call looks like this:

```c
begin_op();
...
bp = bread(...) 	// read block from buffer cache layer
bp->data = ...		// modify the data block
log_write(bp)			// record the write in log
...
end_op();
```

`begin_op` reserves log blocks to hold the writes of this call. `log.outstanding` counts the number of system calls that have reserved log space (per `MAXOPBLOCKS` blocks). 

```c
// called at the start of each FS system call.
void begin_op(void) {
  acquire(&log.lock);
  while(1) {
    if (log.committing) {
      // wait until the logging system is not currently commmitting
      sleep(&log, &log.lock);
    } else if (log.lh.n + (log.outstanding+1)*MAXOPBLOCKS > LOGSIZE) {
      // this op might exhaust log space; wait for commit.
      sleep(&log, &log.lock);
    } else {
      // reserve log blocks 
      log.outstanding += 1;
      release(&log.lock);
      break;
    }
  }
}
```

`log_write` acts as a proxy for `bwrite`. It records the block's sector number in memory, reserving it in a slot in the log, and pins the block in the buffer cache to prevent the buffer cache from evicting it. 

`log_write` notices that a block may be written multiple times during a transaction, and allocates the same slot to the block. This optimization is called absorption.

```c
void log_write(struct buf *b) {
  int i;
  acquire(&log.lock);
  if (log.lh.n >= LOGSIZE || log.lh.n >= log.size - 1)
    panic("too big a transaction");
  if (log.outstanding < 1)
    panic("log_write outside of trans");
  for (i = 0; i < log.lh.n; i++) {
    if (log.lh.block[i] == b->blockno) // log absorption
      break;
  }
  log.lh.block[i] = b->blockno;
  if (i == log.lh.n) {
  	// Add new block to log
    bpin(b);
    log.lh.n++;
  }
  release(&log.lock);
}
```

`end_op` first decrements the count of outstanding system calls. If the count is now zero, it commits the current transaction by calling `commit`. There are four stages in this process:

- `write_log` copies each block modified in the transaction from the buffer cache to its slot in the log.
- `write_head` writes the header block to disk. This is the real commit point. Because if a crash happens before this point, the count on disk is zero, indicating there is no committed transactions. If a crash happens after this point, the recovery mechanism will guarantee that all log blocks will be written to their home locations.
- `install_trans` reads each block from the log and writes it to the proper place in the file system. 
- Finally, `write_head` writes the log header with a count of zero.

```c
static void commit() {
  if (log.lh.n > 0) {
    write_log();      // Write modified blocks from cache to log
    write_head();     // Write header to disk -- the real commit
    install_trans(0); // Now install writes to home locations
    log.lh.n = 0;
    write_head();     // Erase the transaction from the log
  }
}
```

`recover_from_log` is called during boot before the first user process runs. It reads the log header, and mimics the action of `commit` if the header indicates that the log contains a committed transaction.

```c
static void
recover_from_log(void)
{
  read_head();			// read head from disk
  install_trans(1);	// if committed, copy from log to disk
  log.lh.n = 0;
  write_head(); 		// clear the log
}
```
