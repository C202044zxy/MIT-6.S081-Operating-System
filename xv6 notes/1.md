As Figure 1.1 shows, xv6 takes the traditional form of a *kernel*, a special program that provides service to running programs. Each running program, called a *process*, has memory containing instruction, data and a stack.

When a process invokes a kernel service, it invokes a *system call*, one of the calls in the operating system's interface. The kernel performs the service and returns. Thus a process alternates between executing in *user space* and *kernel space*.

The kernel uses the hardware protection mechanism provided by a CPU to ensure that each process executing in user space can only access its own memory. 

The shell is an ordinary program that reads commands for user and executes them. The fact is that the shell is a user program, and not part of the kernel. 

## 1.1 Processes and memory

A process may create a new process using the fork system call. Fork gives new process the exact same memory contents as the calling process. Fork returns in both the original and new processes. 

Although the child has the same memory contents as parent initially, the parent and child are executing with different memory and different registers. Changing a variable in one does not affect the other. 

To avoid the wastefulness of creating a duplicate process and immediately replacing it (with `exec`), operating kernels optimize the implementation of fork by virtual memory techniques such as copy-on-write. 

## 1.2 I/O and File descriptors

A *file descriptor* is a small integer representing a kernel-managed object that a process may read from or write to.

The following code fragment (command `cat`) copies data from its standard input (file descriptor $0$) to its standard output (file descriptor $1$).

```c++
char buf[512];
int n;
for (;;) {
	n = read(0, buf, sizeof buf);
	if (n == 0) {
		break;
	}
	if (n < 0) {
        fprintf(2, "read error\n");
        exit(1);
	}
    if (write(1, buf, n) != n) {
        fprintf(2, "write error\n");
        exit(1);
    }
}
```

The use of file descriptors and the convention that file descriptor 0 is input and file descriptor 1 is output allows a simple implementation of `cat`. 

Fork copies the parent's file descriptor table along with its memory, so that the child starts with exact the same open files as parent. The system call `exec` replaces the calling process's memory but preserves its file descriptor table. 

Here is a simplified version of the code where a shell runs `cat < input.txt`:

```c++
char* argv[2];
argv[0] = "cat";
argv[1] = 0;
if (fork() == 0) {
	close(0);
	open("input.txt", O_RDONLY);
	exec("cat", argv);
}
```

After the child closes file descriptor 0, `open` is guaranteed to use that file descriptor 0 for newly opened `input.txt`. The parent process's file descriptors are not changed, since it only modifies the child's file descriptor table. 

From this example, it is clear that `fork` and `exec` should be separate calls. Between the two, the shell has a chance to redirect the child's I/O without disturbing the I/O setup of the main shell.

Although fork copies the file descriptor table, each underlying file offset is shared between parent and child. Consider the following example:

```c++
if (fork() == 0) {
	write(1, "hello ", 6);
	exit(0);
} else {
	wait(0);
	write(1, "world\n", 6);
}
// "hello world\n" in file descriptor 1
```

Two file descriptors share an offset if they were derived from the same original file descriptor by a sequence of `fork` and `dup` calls. Otherwise file descriptors do not share offsets, even if they resulted from `open` calls of the same file. 

File descriptors are powerful abstractions, because they hide the details of what they connect to. Writing to file descriptor 1 may be writing to a file, to a device like the console, or to a pipe. 

## 1.3 Pipe

A *pipe* is a small kernel buffer exposed to processes as a pair of file descriptors, one for reading and one for writing. 

The following code fragment filters out all prime numbers using pipe:

```c++
void child(int rd) {
  int p[2] = {};
  int num = 0, prime = 0, setNext = 0;
  // read numbers from the reading end
  // the first number must be a prime
  read(rd, &prime, 4);
  printf("prime %d\n", prime);
  while (read(rd, &num, 4) != 0) {
    if (num % prime == 0) {
      // not a prime
      continue; 
    }
    if (setNext == 0) {
      setNext = 1;
      // create the pipe.
      // p[0] for reading, p[1] for writing.
      pipe(p);
      if (fork() == 0) {
        // close the writing end in child process.
        // this does not interfere
        // file descriptor table of parent process.
        close(p[1]);
        child(p[0]);
        close(p[0]);
        return ;
      } else {
        // colse the reading end in parent process.
        // this does not interfere 
        // file descriptor table of child process. 
        close(p[0]);
      }
    }
    // write to the pipe
    write(p[1], &num, 4);
  }
  if (p[1]) {
    close(p[1]);
  }
  wait(0); // wait for child process to complete
}
```

Pipes have at least four advantages over temporary files in this situation.

1. Pipes automatically clean themselves up. 
2. Pipes can pass arbitrarily long streams of data.
3. Pipes allows parallel execution of pipeline stages.
4. If you are implementing inter-process communication, pipes' blocking reads and writes are more efficient than the non-blocking semantics of files. 

## 1.4 File system

A *path* like `a/b/c` refers to the file or directory named `c` inside the directory named `b` inside the directory named `a` in the root directory `/`. Paths that don't begin with `/` are evaluated relative to the calling process's current directory.

A file's name is distinct from the file itself. The same underlying file, called an *inode*, can have multiple names, called *links*. An inode holds metadata about a file.

The `unlink` system call removes a name from the file system. The file's inode and the disk space holding its content are only freed when the file's link count is zero and no file descriptor refers to it.
