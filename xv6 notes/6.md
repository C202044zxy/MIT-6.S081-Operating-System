The word *concurrency* refers to the situations in which multiple instructions are interleaved, due to multiprocessor parallelism, thread switching, or interrupts. 

Strategies aimed at correctness under concurrency, and abstractions that support them, are called *concurrency control* techniques. 

A lock provides mutual exclusion, ensuring that only one CPU at a time can hold the lock. If a programmer associates a lock with each shared data item, and the code always holds the associated lock when using an item, then the item will be used by only one CPU at a time. 

## 6.1 Race conditions

Let's examine an example of a link list shared by two CPUs.

```c
void push(intdata) {
	structelement *l;
 	l = malloc(sizeof *l);
 	l->data = data;
  l->next = list;
 	list = l;
}
```

If two CPUs run instructions in an order of Figure 6.2, there will be two `next` set to the former value of `list`. And the first assignment to `list` will be lost. 

The lost update is an example of *race condition*. A race condition is a situation in which a memory location is accessed concurrently, and at least one access is a write. 

The usual way to avoid races is to use a lock. Locks ensure mutual exclusion, so that only one CPU at a time can execute the *critical section*.

```c
...
acquire(&listlock);
// critical section
l->next = list;
list = l;
release(&listlock);
...
```

Invariants are properties of data structures that are maintained across operations. Typically, an operation's correct behaviour depends on the invariants being true when the operation begins. The operation may temporarily violate the invariants but must rebuild them before finishing. 

In the linked list case, the invariant is that `list` points at the first element in the list and each `next` points at the next element. The race condition happens because the second CPU executes code depended on the list invariants while they were temporarily violated. 

You can think of a lock as *serializing* concurrent critical sections so that they run one at a time, and thus preserve the invariants (assuming critical sections are correct in isolation). Multiple processes *conflict* if they want the same lock at the same time, or that the lock experiences *contention*.

## 6.3 Using locks

First, any time a variable can be written by one CPU at the same time that another CPU can read or write it, a lock should be used to keep the two operations from overlapping. Second, remember that locks protect invariants: if an invariant involves multiple memory locations, typically all of them need to be protected by a single lock to ensure the invariant is maintained.

## 6.4 Deadlock and lock ordering

If a code path through the kernel must hold several locks at the time, it is important that all code paths acquire those locks in the same order. If they don't, there is a risk of deadlock. To avoid such deadlocks, all code paths must acquire locks in the same order.

## 6.6 Locks and interrupt handlers

If a spinlock is used by an interrupt handler, a CPU must never hold that lock with interrupts enabled. Otherwise a deadlock may occur. Xv6 is more conservative: when a CPU acquires any lock, xv6 always disables interrupts on that CPU.

`acquire` calls `push_off` and release calls `pop_off` to track the nesting level of locks on the concurrent CPU. When that count reaches zero, `pop_off` restores the interrupt enable state that existed at the start of the outermost critical section (`intena`).

It is important that `acquire` calls `push_off` strictly before setting `lk->locked`. If the two were reversed, there would be a brief window when the lock was held with interrupts enabled, and an unfortunately timed interrupt would deadlock the system.

## 6.8 Sleep locks

Sleep-lock yields the CPU while waiting to acquire, and allows yields (and interrupts) while the lock is held.

Because sleep-locks leave interrupts enabled, they can not be used in interrupt handlers. Because `acquiresleep` may yield the CPU, sleep-locks can not be used inside spinlock critical sections, but not vice versa.

Spinlocks are best suited to short critical sections, since waiting for them wastes CPU time. Sleep-locks work well for lengthy operations.
