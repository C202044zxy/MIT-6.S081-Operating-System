An operating system must fulfill there requirements: multiplexing, isolation and interaction. 

## 2.1 Abstract physical resources

To achieve strong isolation it's helpful to forbid applications from directly accessing sensitive hardware resources, and instead to abstract the resources into service. For example, Unix applications interact with storage only through the file system's `open/read/write` and `close` system calls, instead of reading and writing to disk directly. 

Similarly, Unix transparently switches hardware CPUs among processes, saving and restoring register state as necessary, so that application don't have to be aware of time sharing. 

## 2.2 User mode, supervisor mode, system calls

CPUs provide hardware support for strong isolation. For example, RISC-V has three modes in which the CPU can execute instructions: machine mode, supervisor mode, and user mode. Instructions executing in machine mode have full privilege â€” A CPU starts in machine mode. 

An application executing only user mode instructions is said to be running in *user space*. Software in supervisor mode can also execute privileged instructions and is said to be running in *kernel space*. The software running in kernel space is *kernel*.

## 2.3 Kernel organization

One possibility is that the entire operating system resides in the kernel, so that the implementations of all system calls run in supervisor mode. This organization is called the *monolithic kernel*.

In a monolithic kernel, a mistake is fatal, because an error in supervisor mode will often cause the kernel to fail. 

To reduce the risk of mistakes in the kernel, OS designers can reduce the amount of code running in supervisor mode, and execute the bulk of operating system in user mode. This kernel organization is called a *microkernel*.

Figure 2.1 illustrates this microkernel design. In the figure, the file system runs as a user-level process. To allow applications to interact with the file server, the kernel provides an inter-process communication mechanism to send messages from one user-mode process to another. 

## 2.5 Process overview

The process abstraction prevents one process from wrecking or spying on another process's memory, CPU, file descriptor, etc. It also prevents a process from wrecking the kernel itself, so that a process can't subvert the kernel's isolation mechanisms. 

Xv6 uses page tables to give each process its own address space. The RISC-V page table translates a *virtual address* to a *physical address*.

Each process has two stacks: a user stack and a kernel stack. When the process is executing user instructions, only its user stack is in use, and its kernel stack is empty.
